### Heey 👋

I am **Luisa Nunes**,
<br><br>
I am a highly analytical professional currently pursuing a Higher Diploma in Science in Computing, eager to transition my career into the tech industry. I have a passion for exploring and studying new technologies and programming innovations.

During my career as a Fashion Product Designer, I developed advanced attention to detail and visual design skills. I also acquired a wide range of transferable skills directly applicable to the IT sector, including a strong focus on putting consumers and users first. I am adept at analyzing consumer data and behavioral insights to inform design decisions.

To enhance my professional skills and satisfy my quest for continuous learning, I have pursued a Diploma in UX Design and a Higher Diploma in Science in Computing. Through these programs, I have gained hands-on experience across various technology domains in demanding projects. These experiences have expanded my knowledge in areas such as Object-Oriented Software Engineering, Software Development, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems and Networks, Data Structures, Algorithms, Advanced Programming, UX Design, and User Experience.

Feel free to reach out to me—I would be happy to connect!
